Tottenham will be looking to keep their momentum rolling and heap more trouble onto Manchester City when the two sides square off on Wednesday.

Spurs will step onto their home turf with confidence, knowing they already got the better of the reigning Premier League champions earlier this season — albeit in the Carabao Cup. Ange Postecoglou, who has had his fair share of critics, understands that a statement win over City could give his side a major boost in the league standings.

Meanwhile, City’s title dreams have all but crumbled, leaving them scrapping for a Champions League spot instead. Their 2-0 defeat to Liverpool sent them tumbling to fourth place, where they now sit level on points with Newcastle, clinging to a higher position only by the slimmest of goal differences.
