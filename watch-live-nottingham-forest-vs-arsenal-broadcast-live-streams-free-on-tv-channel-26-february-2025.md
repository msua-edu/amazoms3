Arsenal will be aiming to avoid falling further behind at the top of the Premier League table when they face Nottingham Forest tonight.

The Gunners saw their 15-game unbeaten run in the competition come to an end at the weekend as they fell to a disappointing 1-0 loss at home to West Ham.

That result, coupled with Liverpool beating Manchester City the following day means an 11-point gap separates the two sides following what was a huge weekend in this season's title race.

Though Arsenal have played a game fewer than the leaders, it's looking like an uphill battle to stop Arne Slot's side from being crowned champions of England.

Things do not get easier for the north London outfit either as they travel to the City Ground to face a Nottingham Forest side that has emerged as surprise contenders for Champions League qualification.

Despite losing 4-3 to Newcastle at the weekend, Forest are strong at home and will be out to close the gap on Arsenal to three points and perhaps signal their intent to battle for a top-two finish.

It promises to be a fascinating encounter and with that said, here’s a look at everything you need to know about where to watch the game.

How to watch Nottingham Forest vs Arsenal
TV channel: The game will be broadcast on TNT Sports 2. Coverage starts at 6.30pm GMT ahead of an 7.30pm kick-off.
Playing on home turf gives Forest an edge, but if they want to knock off the Gunners, they’ll need to string together a more consistent performance. Their last outing against Newcastle was a tight battle, yet they couldn’t quite crack the Magpies’ defense and ended up on the wrong side of the scoreline.

As for Arsenal, confidence isn’t exactly sky-high after a frustrating loss to 16th-placed West Ham. Despite peppering the Hammers with attacks, they couldn’t find a way past the defense. If they want to leave the City Ground with all three points, they’ll have to sharpen their finishing and bring their A-game in the final third.
Here's how that time translates across the U.S.:

Arsenal vs. Nottingham Forest predicted lineups, team news
Arsenal’s weekend went from bad to worse in the blink of an eye, as Myles Lewis-Skelly—brought on in the second half—found himself making unwanted history with a record-breaking red card. The teenager was sent packing for denying Mohammed Kudus a clear scoring chance after the Ghanaian dispossessed him, adding insult to injury on an already frustrating day.

Unlike his controversial dismissal against Wolves, Arsenal isn’t expected to challenge this one, meaning Lewis-Skelly will serve his suspension on Wednesday. That likely opens the door for Riccardo Calafiori to redeem himself after a rough outing against West Ham.

The Gunners’ absentee list continues to grow, with Lewis-Skelly now joining Bukayo Saka (hamstring), Gabriel Martinelli (hamstring), Takehiro Tomiyasu (knee), Kai Havertz (hamstring), and Gabriel Jesus (ACL) on the sidelines. However, Ethan Nwaneri should be fit despite exiting with fatigue over the weekend.

Mikel Arteta’s midfield gamble with Mikel Merino didn’t pay off, but his alternatives are limited. The only real option would be to reintroduce Raheem Sterling, though the Arsenal boss seemed hesitant to turn to the struggling winger before Nwaneri’s early exit.

Arsenal predicted lineup (4-3-3, right to left): Raya (GK) — Timber, Saliba, Gabriel, Calafiori — Odegaard, Partey, Rice — Nwaneri, Merino, Trossard

Injured: Bukayo Saka (hamstring), Gabriel Martinelli (hamstring), Takehiro Tomiyasu (knee), Kai Havertz (hamstring), and Gabriel Jesus (ACL)
Suspended: Myles Lewis-Skelly

Unlike their injury-riddled opponents, Nottingham Forest head into Wednesday’s clash with a near-clean bill of health. The only absentee is backup shot-stopper Carlos Miguel, who remains sidelined with a hamstring issue.

However, Nuno Espírito Santo has a tactical conundrum on his hands as he plots a way to frustrate the Gunners. The Tricky Trees have dabbled with a back-three setup this season, and considering how Arsenal crumbled against a similarly structured West Ham side, the former Tottenham boss might be tempted to borrow a page from Graham Potter’s tactical playbook.

Nottingham Forest predicted lineup (3-4-2-1, right to left): Sels (GK) — Milenkovic, Murillo, Morato — Aina, Anderson, Yates, Williams — Gibbs-White, Hudson-Odoi — Wood

Injured: Carlos Miguel (hamstring)
Suspended: None

Arsenal vs. Nottingham Forest prediction
Forest’s defensive meltdown at Newcastle might not mean much come Wednesday, as they’ll be back in the comfort of their City Ground stronghold, facing an Arsenal side that looked anything but lethal in attack over the weekend.

The Gunners may still boast the league’s best defensive record on paper, and if Santo opts for a defense-first approach, they shouldn’t have too much trouble keeping the Tricky Trees quiet. But with their own frontline looking toothless, Arsenal could find themselves stuck in a goalless gridlock—one that might just slam the door shut on their fading title hopes.

Prediction: Arsenal 0-0 Nottingham Forest
