Liverpool face Newcastle tonight in a dress rehearsal for next month’s Carabao Cup final.

The Reds are bouncing at the moment following the perfect set of results in the Premier League at the weekend.

Victory over reigning champions Manchester City was coupled with Arsenal's shock defeat to West Ham which means Liverpool now have an 11-point lead at the top of the table.

Though Arne Slot's side have played a game more than their nearest challengers, it will take an astonishing set of results to deny the Reds the Premier League title come May.

Belief that the trophy is Anfield-bound will only increase if Liverpool beat Newcastle tonight and Arsenal drop points away at Nottingham Forest.

Having said that, Newcastle are a tough nut to crack on the road. They have beaten Manchester United, Tottenham and Arsenal away from home in recent weeks and will be looking to give a better account of themselves after losing 4-0 to Man City earlier in the month.

It finished 3-3 in the reverse meeting earlier this season and all signs are pointing towards plenty of goals tonight!

Here’s a look at everything you need to know about where to watch the game...

Liverpool brace for a stern test at Anfield on Wednesday night as Newcastle United come knocking in a high-stakes Premier League showdown.

Fresh off a statement 2-0 victory over Manchester City, the Reds have tightened their grip at the top of the table and have their sights set firmly on the title. But this clash isn’t just about league positioning—it also serves as a dress rehearsal before the two sides cross paths again in next month’s EFL Cup final.

On the other side, Newcastle arrive in high spirits after a thrilling 4-3 triumph over Nottingham Forest. However, they’ll have their work cut out for them against a Liverpool side that looks more and more like champions with each passing game.
